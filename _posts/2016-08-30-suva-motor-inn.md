# Suva Motor Inn

Our room at Peninsula was not quite as advertised. Instead of a second bed, there was a kitchen. And there was an air-con unit on the wall, but we weren't able to get it working. There was no remote, and after calling the front desk a second time we were advised they hadn't been able to locate one, but would let us know when they found it. We were never contacted again. I opened the front cover to see if there were manual controls, but was instead confronted by exposed 240 volt wiring.

Our room was also located on the top floor and there is no elevator, so staff carried our bag up the stairs. Fortunately we only had one light bag.
