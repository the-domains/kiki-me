  I’m in Fiji. Just for a week - too long to be away from my baby, but not
  enough time to meet many friends. Next time it will be the two of us coming
  here. She wants to meet some of my friends, but of course she wants some "us
  time” as well. Which I'm more than happy to accommodate. It might be too warm
  to cuddle, though, so I have to think up some other activities we will both
  enjoy. Can't wait to be together again!

# So far away from 

I'm in Fiji. Just for a week - too long to be away from my baby, but not enough time to meet many friends. Next time it will be the two of us coming here. She wants to meet some of my friends, but of course she wants some "us time" as well. Which I'm more than happy to accommodate.
